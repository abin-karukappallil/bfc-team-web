        </h1>
        <P>
            Bengaluru FC, which was established by the JSW Group in 2013, has made an indelible mark in the Indian football arena. In their maiden season in the I-League, the team clinched the championship, thereby becoming the first-ever team to achieve this feat in their debut season. Since then, they have continued to maintain their dominance by winning the title twice more in the 2015-16 and 2018-19 seasons. Bengaluru FC has established itself as one of the most triumphant football clubs in India, having triumphed in almost every league, including the Federation Cup and Super Cup.
